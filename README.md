## About

A collection of mini mods intended for Xenonauts, made by me.

Includes the mods listed below with their respective descriptions:

### Deluxe Geoscape Cheat
~~~
COMMANDER, TAKE OUR MONEY, ALL OF IT. STOP THE ALIENS!
'
- Ridiculous money (800 Million!!!)
- Tons of alloy/alenium loot from UFOs
- Better soldier stats
- Epic plane upgrades
- Luxury base buildings
- Efficient refuel and rearm for planes
- Mindcontrol psionics nefred to hell
- Super flares for night ops (Super Flares! mod included)
- QuantumCryptology Center also a super radar now
'
You're basically swimming in money and alloys, plus get many quality of life improvements for Geoscape.
This is the Deluxe Geoscape Cheat Mod.
'
(Ground combat unchanged, only flares buffed)
~~~
### Super Flares!
~~~
NO MORE DARKNESS! PRAISE THE SUN!
'
Modifies night mission flares:
- Minimal TU Cost
- Ridiculous Throw Range
- Gigantic Radius of Light
'
Night-time missions should be far more enjoyable now
~~~
### Minutemen: 8000 TUs
~~~
Your soldiers get 8000 TUs.
'
Blitz through an entire ground combat mission in one turn, stay out of alien reaction fire, teleport behind aliens and say "pssh, nothing personnel kid" as you pick them off one by one.
'
A power fantasy cheat mod for when you just want to wreck aliens with impunity.
~~~
### New Game+ Graviton Beam Emitter
~~~
Adds the Graviton Beam Emitter, a BLAME! inspired weapon for soldier use.
'
Changes the gameplay into a more fast-paced, reckless and overkill experience overall. You get the weapon after researching Alien Plasma Rifle, which is very early on.
'
The weapon is lightweight, features two firing modes, 1000 ammo, extreme damage, 1,5 tile area of effect per shot, low TU per shot, very high accuracy and comes in unlimited amount for all soldiers to use. Turn entire levels into burned wastelands, demolish houses and murder multiple aliens in a single turn. Use manual fire to destroy walls to walk through them.
'
BONUS: For added exciting challenge, try to beat the game with a limited 1-4 hero squad using GBEs.
'
SPECIAL NOTE:
This is not completely a cheat mod. I called it a newgame+ for a reason.
You will kill aliens fast, yes, but relying on this weapon has some things you will notice:
1. Loot is extremely limited due to explosions = overall less money for the Geoscape
2. The confidence the gun gives you encourages you to rush = easier to die
3. Less money = cant afford armor. You may end up running through the whole game naked
4. Less money = cant afford bases. Aliens can terrorize much of the world easier
5. Less money = less upgrades. You may need to skip a lot of tiers to surviv
